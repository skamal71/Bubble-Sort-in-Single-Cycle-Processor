## As part of my computer architecture learnings, here I implemented bubble sort algorithm in a Single Cycle Processor in Verilog. \nVerilog is a Hardware Development Language. It is commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register-transfer level of abstraction. It is also used in the verification of analog circuits and mixed-signal circuits, as well as in the design of genetic circuits.
